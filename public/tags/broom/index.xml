      <description>Way back in 2016, the USDA released a study entitled “Foods Typically Purchased by Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Households,” including a summary, final report, and appendices. Per the USDA’s description:
 This study uses calendar year 2011 point-of-sale transaction data from a leading grocery retailer to examine the food choices of SNAP and non-SNAP households.
 At the time though, I was most interested in looking at the appendices data - 263 pages full of tables detailing the commodities and categories of food bought by both families served and not served by SNAP.</description>
