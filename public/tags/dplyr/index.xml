      <description>I moved to Seattle at the end of 2016 and since then have done around 100 hikes (depending on your definition of ‘a hike’!). I must admit I’ve been abysmal at tracking any data regarding my hiking activity beyond a Google spreadsheet, despite the ubiquity of trail tracking apps that exist.
Recently, I signed up on AllTrails to start collecting data on my hikes. The Pro service offers many wonderful features, including the ability to download GPX data on hikes.</description>

      <description>Way back in 2016, the USDA released a study entitled “Foods Typically Purchased by Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Households,” including a summary, final report, and appendices. Per the USDA’s description:
This study uses calendar year 2011 point-of-sale transaction data from a leading grocery retailer to examine the food choices of SNAP and non-SNAP households.
At the time though, I was most interested in looking at the appendices data - 263 pages full of tables detailing the commodities and categories of food bought by both families served and not served by SNAP.</description>

      <description>I am a data analyst committed to nonprofit work with the aim of reducing racial and socioeconomic inequities. Data, and in particular disaggregated data, can provide measures of the equity of a system, process, or program. Displaying data by subgroups is an important step in any data team’s equity journey, and exploring these data beyond averages can highlight the most prominent equity needs.
In this post, I define what disaggregated data is and how it can inform teams on their equity work.</description>
