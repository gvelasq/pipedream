      <title>Taking A Peek into My Hiking Data</title>

      <description>I moved to Seattle at the end of 2016 and since then have done over 100 hikes (depending on your definition of ‘a hike’!). I must admit I’ve been abysmal at tracking any data regarding my hiking activity beyond a Google spreadsheet, despite the ubiquity of trail tracking apps that exist.
Recently, I signed up on AllTrails to start collecting data on my hikes. The Pro service offers many wonderful features, including the ability to download GPX data on hikes.</description>

      <description>Way back in 2016, the USDA released a study entitled “Foods Typically Purchased by Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Households,” including a summary, final report, and appendices. Per the USDA’s description:
 This study uses calendar year 2011 point-of-sale transaction data from a leading grocery retailer to examine the food choices of SNAP and non-SNAP households.
 At the time though, I was most interested in looking at the appendices data - 263 pages full of tables detailing the commodities and categories of food bought by both families served and not served by SNAP.</description>
