      <description>My good friend Ryan Estrellado recommended an NPR Planet Money podcast episode on the “Modal American.” Working with Ben Casselman, Planet Money explored the most ‘typical’ American. It was a fantastic, engaging episode about a common statistical technique that I’ve never seen applied in this way before. They ran the numbers on a variety of demographic variables to see what group is the most common in the U.S. (I highly recommend the episode - it’s pretty surprising!</description>

&lt;p&gt;I am a data analyst committed to nonprofit work with the aim of reducing racial and socioeconomic inequities. Data, and in particular disaggregated data, can provide measures of the equity of a system, process, or program. Displaying data by subgroups is an important step in any data team’s equity journey, and exploring these data beyond averages can highlight the most prominent equity needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I define what disaggregated data is and how it can inform teams on their equity work. Then, I run various cuts on Minneapolis Public Schools data. The district’s reporting of the composition of their schools provides an excellent opportunity to explore inequities in a system.&lt;/p&gt;
