      <description>I would like to introduce {leaidr}, a package for mapping U.S. School District shapefiles!
Inspired by my coauthor Joshua Rosenberg, the goal of {leaidr} is to facilitate the download and use of school district shapefiles.
School districts in the U.S. have associated local education agency identification numbers (LEAID) used in the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Common Core of Data. These are very useful because if you have other datasets with NCES IDâ€™s, then you can (sometimes easily) join them.</description>
