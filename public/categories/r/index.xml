      <title>What It Takes to Tidy Census Data</title>

      <description>The U.S. Census releases aggregate data on their Household Pulse Survey. These data are super interesting and cover a range of important topics, particularly those related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
First of all, let me clarify that I think that the work that the Census does is amazing and I am so glad that these data are available. But, when you download the data, you will see that it is a highly stylized Excel spreadsheet.</description>

      <title>Creating an R Package for School District Shapefiles</title>

      <description>I would like to introduce {leaidr}, a package for mapping U.S. School District shapefiles!
Inspired by my coauthor Joshua Rosenberg, the goal of {leaidr} is to facilitate the download and use of school district shapefiles.
School districts in the U.S. have associated local education agency identification numbers (LEAID) used in the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Common Core of Data. These are very useful because if you have other datasets with NCES ID‚Äôs, then you can (sometimes easily) join them.</description>

      <description>I got to be the @WeAreRLadies curator for the week of February 10th and it was a great experience to get feedback from a wider swath of the R community. One question I posed was how people organize the folders within their projects, and I got a lot of engagement! For this blogpost, I categorize the common themes from these different resources and then list them all out at the end of the post.</description>

      <description>I often use {ggplot2} to create graphs but there are certain things I always have to Google. I figured I‚Äôd create a post for quick reference for myself but I‚Äôd love to hear what you always have to look up!

      <description>My good friend Ryan Estrellado recommended an NPR Planet Money podcast episode on the ‚ÄúModal American.‚Äù Working with Ben Casselman, Planet Money explored the most ‚Äòtypical‚Äô American. It was a fantastic, engaging episode about a common statistical technique that I‚Äôve never seen applied in this way before. They ran the numbers on a variety of demographic variables to see what group is the most common in the U.S. (I highly recommend the episode - it‚Äôs pretty surprising!</description>

      <title>Taking A Peek into My Hiking Data</title>

      <description>I moved to Seattle at the end of 2016 and since then have done over 100 hikes (depending on your definition of ‚Äòa hike‚Äô!). I must admit I‚Äôve been abysmal at tracking any data regarding my hiking activity beyond a Google spreadsheet, despite the ubiquity of trail tracking apps that exist.
Recently, I signed up on AllTrails to start collecting data on my hikes. The Pro service offers many wonderful features, including the ability to download GPX data on hikes.</description>

      <description>Way back in 2016, the USDA released a study entitled ‚ÄúFoods Typically Purchased by Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Households,‚Äù including a summary, final report, and appendices. Per the USDA‚Äôs description:
 This study uses calendar year 2011 point-of-sale transaction data from a leading grocery retailer to examine the food choices of SNAP and non-SNAP households.
 At the time though, I was most interested in looking at the appendices data - 263 pages full of tables detailing the commodities and categories of food bought by both families served and not served by SNAP.</description>

      <title>Disaggregating Minneapolis Public Schools Data</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;I am a data analyst committed to nonprofit work with the aim of reducing racial and socioeconomic inequities. Data, and in particular disaggregated data, can provide measures of the equity of a system, process, or program. Displaying data by subgroups is an important step in any data team‚Äôs equity journey, and exploring these data beyond averages can highlight the most prominent equity needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I define what disaggregated data is and how it can inform teams on their equity work. Then, I run various cuts on Minneapolis Public Schools data. The district‚Äôs reporting of the composition of their schools provides an excellent opportunity to explore inequities in a system.&lt;/p&gt;
