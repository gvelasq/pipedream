      <description>As the @WeAreRLadies curator, I asked the Twitterverse for advice when submitting to CRAN for the first time. Many people replied and offer their tips, experience, and well wishes. I have summarized everybodyâ€™s replies below. THANK YOU all for participating!
Hereâ€™s what to expect when succeeding to get your package on CRAN!
 I don&amp;#39;t know you, but I believe in you ðŸ¤©

      <description>The new school year is right around the corner and I have gotten a few requests from new students entering a Data Science or Analyst program to talk about my experience in graduate school. I graduated with a Masters of Science in Analytics from the University of Chicago in June 2016. It was an amazing experience that helped propel me into a new career but there are definitely things I wish I had known or would have done differently.</description>
