      <title>Browse and Search Liked Tweets using R</title>

      <description>The other day, I was scrolling through my ‚Äúliked‚Äù Tweets and got maybe 100 deep when I accidentally clicked a hyperlink and had to restart scrolling from the beginning. The experience made me so frustrated that I started looking up easier ways of perusing one‚Äôs likes. I found this tutorial that walked through how to pull liked Tweets into a CSV using Python - so I decided to give it a shot using R.</description>

      <title>Even Easier-to-Use R Package for School District Shapefiles</title>

      <description>leaidr Update A few months ago, I created {leaidr} for easier download of U.S. school district shapefiles. Daniel Anderson went through and greatly improved the package, making it even easier to download and use the shapefiles (thanks Dan!).
Now, instead of having to run lea_prep(), you can download the shapefiles from Dan‚Äôs Github repository like so:
library(leaidr) tn &amp;lt;- lea_get(&amp;quot;tn&amp;quot;) ## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile ## Source: &amp;quot;/private/var/folders/pj/nmg9b8_93dq4kwt8nt2d4cj40000gn/T/RtmpCFlfFo/47&amp;quot;, layer: &amp;quot;47&amp;quot; ## with 158 features ## It has 18 fields tn %&amp;gt;% sf::st_as_sf() %&amp;gt;% ggplot2::ggplot() + ggplot2::geom_sf() And, if you use lea_get() (i.</description>

      <title>What It Takes to Tidy Census Data</title>

      <description>The U.S. Census releases aggregate data on their Household Pulse Survey. These data are super interesting and cover a range of important topics, particularly those related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
First of all, let me clarify that I think that the work that the Census does is amazing and I am so glad that these data are available. But, when you download the data, you will see that it is a highly stylized Excel spreadsheet.</description>

      <title>Creating an R Package for School District Shapefiles</title>

      <description>I would like to introduce {leaidr}, a package for mapping U.S. School District shapefiles!
Inspired by my coauthor Joshua Rosenberg, the goal of {leaidr} is to facilitate the download and use of school district shapefiles.
School districts in the U.S. have associated local education agency identification numbers (LEAID) used in the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Common Core of Data. These are very useful because if you have other datasets with NCES ID‚Äôs, then you can (sometimes easily) join them.</description>

      <description>As the @WeAreRLadies curator, I asked the Twitterverse for advice when submitting to CRAN for the first time. Many people replied and offer their tips, experience, and well wishes. I have summarized everybody‚Äôs replies below. THANK YOU all for participating!
Here‚Äôs what to expect when succeeding to get your package on CRAN!
 I don&amp;#39;t know you, but I believe in you ü§©

      <description>I got to be the @WeAreRLadies curator for the week of February 10th and it was a great experience to get feedback from a wider swath of the R community. One question I posed was how people organize the folders within their projects, and I got a lot of engagement! For this blogpost, I categorize the common themes from these different resources and then list them all out at the end of the post.</description>

      <description>I often use {ggplot2} to create graphs but there are certain things I always have to Google. I figured I‚Äôd create a post for quick reference for myself but I‚Äôd love to hear what you always have to look up!

      <description>My good friend Ryan Estrellado recommended an NPR Planet Money podcast episode on the ‚ÄúModal American.‚Äù Working with Ben Casselman, Planet Money explored the most ‚Äòtypical‚Äô American. It was a fantastic, engaging episode about a common statistical technique that I‚Äôve never seen applied in this way before. They ran the numbers on a variety of demographic variables to see what group is the most common in the U.S. (I highly recommend the episode - it‚Äôs pretty surprising!</description>

      <title>Taking A Peek into My Hiking Data</title>

      <description>I moved to Seattle at the end of 2016 and since then have done over 100 hikes (depending on your definition of ‚Äòa hike‚Äô!). I must admit I‚Äôve been abysmal at tracking any data regarding my hiking activity beyond a Google spreadsheet, despite the ubiquity of trail tracking apps that exist.
Recently, I signed up on AllTrails to start collecting data on my hikes. The Pro service offers many wonderful features, including the ability to download GPX data on hikes.</description>
