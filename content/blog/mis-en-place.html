<p>I got to be the <span class="citation">@WeAreRLadies</span> curator for the week of February 10th and it was a great experience to get feedback from a wider swath of the R community. One question I posed was how people organize the folders within their projects, and I got a lot of engagement! For this blogpost, I categorize the common themes from these different resources and then list them all out at the end of the post.</p>
