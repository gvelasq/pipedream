<p>I moved to Seattle at the end of 2016 and since then have done around 100 hikes (depending on your definition of ‘a hike’!). I must admit I’ve been abysmal at tracking any data regarding my hiking activity beyond a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y3NdGea6yVuoDS7ewUKmuKGZouzU62FHK-aY813TafA/edit?usp=sharing">Google spreadsheet</a>, despite the ubiquity of trail tracking apps that exist.</p>
<p>Recently, I signed up on <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/">AllTrails</a> to start collecting data on my hikes. The Pro service offers many wonderful features, including the ability to download GPX data on hikes. I was so excited by this that I decided to try to calculate my ‘average hike.’</p>
<p>Generally speaking, people consider two main metrics in choosing a hike: distance and elevation. So what would my ‘average hike’ look like? Would my average hike mean average distance, average elevation, or both? Why not all three?!</p>
<p>I’m structuring this article a bit differently with the results/visualizations first, but for anybody dying to see the data cleaning process, please see the <a href="#methodology">Methodology</a> section below!</p>
<div id="i-dont-particularly-love-long-hikes" class="section level1">
<h1>I don’t particularly love long hikes</h1>
<p>My average hike is 6.4 miles - and most of them are concentrated around that distance. This makes sense as I usually day hike and need to get back at a reasonable time.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>For data collection, I downloaded each trail’s GPX files from AllTrails. Because these data are proprietary, I will not be showing them here. Some things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because these are data pulled from the AllTrails website, they are not indicative of my actual hiking path (for example, Franklin Falls is a 2 mile hike in the summer, but in the winter is a 6 mile snowshoe).</li>
<li>There are hikes that I did back-to-back that I’d consider one hike but the trails might be listed separately on the site. For example, Deception Pass is actually made up of three small loops.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="choose-packages" class="section level2">
<h2>Choose Packages</h2>
<p>It took a bit to decide which packages had the functions needed to run the spatial analyses. In the end, I decided on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>plotKML</strong>: A package containing functions to read GPX files</li>
<li><strong>geosphere</strong>: A package containing functions for geospatial calculations. I decided to use this for finding out distances between lon/lat.</li>
<li><strong>googleway</strong>: A package allowing access to the Google Maps API. To run this, you need to obtain a Google Maps API key and load it to R by using <code>set_key()</code>. I use this for elevation calculations but the API can also obtain distance between points.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(googleway)
library(plotKML)
library(geosphere)

googleway::set_key(API_KEY_HERE)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="data-upload" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Upload</h2>
<p>I downloaded each GPX file from AllTrails and saved them in a file in my project organization. Their file names were TRAILNAME.gpx.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using <code>plotKML::readGPX</code> results in the files being loaded as lists.</li>
<li>I used <code>purrr</code> in conjunction with <code>plotKML()</code> to handily read them in and add the file name to the list.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code># find gpx files
data_path &lt;- 
  here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;raw&quot;, &quot;gpx_files&quot;)

files &lt;-
  dir(data_path, pattern = &quot;*.gpx&quot;, full.names = TRUE)

# get trail names
names &lt;-
  dir(data_path, pattern = &quot;*.gpx&quot;, full.names = FALSE) %&gt;% 
  str_extract(&quot;.+?(?=.gpx)&quot;)

# read all gpx files
gpx_dat &lt;-
  map2(files,
       names,
       ~ readGPX(.x,
         metadata = TRUE,
         bounds = TRUE,
         waypoints = TRUE,
         tracks = TRUE,
         routes = TRUE) %&gt;%
         list_modify(trail = .y)) # otherwise you can&#39;t tell which entry is for which trail</code></pre>

<div id="calculate-distance" class="section level2">
<h2>Calculate Distance</h2>
<p>Now we have a list of trails and longitudes and latitudes along their paths.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can use <code>map_df()</code> to transform the information into a dataframe.</li>
<li>To use calculate distance, we can use <code>distHaversine()</code> with two sets of lon/lat. We can create the second set of lon/lat by creating a new variable that takes the “next” value in a vector (so we’re calculating the distance between point A and point B, point B to point C, and so on).</li>
<li>Finally, cumsum accumulates the distances between each set of lon/lat.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>dat_lonlat &lt;-
  gpx_dat %&gt;%
  map_df(., ~.x$&quot;routes&quot;[[1]], .id = &quot;trail&quot;) %&gt;%
  select(trail, lon, lat) %&gt;% 
  group_by(trail) %&gt;% 
  mutate(lon2 = lead(lon, 1),
         lat2 = lead(lat, 1))

dat_dist &lt;-
  dat_lonlat %&gt;% 
  ungroup() %&gt;% 
  mutate(dist = distHaversine(dat_lonlat[, 2:3], dat_lonlat[, 4:5])) %&gt;% 
  group_by(trail) %&gt;% 
  mutate(cumdist = cumsum(dist/1609.344)) # to convert to miles

dat_dist_agg &lt;-
  dat_dist %&gt;% 
  group_by(trail) %&gt;% 
  summarize(sum = sum(dist, na.rm = T))
