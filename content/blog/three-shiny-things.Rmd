I've commonly heard (and experienced) that Shiny apps "look Shiny", as in, it's really clear when you look at an app whether or not it is a Shiny app. It may be the font, layout, or interactivity, but something about them is uniform across most of the apps that you see (I could argue the same for most Tableau dashboards too...). This is not to say that the "Shiny" look is not good, but I have been trying to find ways of making them "prettier" - more aesthetically pleasing, and a little less uniform than the standard template.

## Change the Font


## Add {scales} to your DT
