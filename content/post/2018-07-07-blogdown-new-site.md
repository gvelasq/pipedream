As a member of [R-Ladies Seattle](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-seattle/), I offered to give a talk on [blogdown](https://slides.yihui.name/2017-rstudio-conf-blogdown-Yihui-Xie.html#6), a recent package by Yihui Xie that uses R Markdown and Hugo to create static websites. While I was very excited to participate, there was a small snafu: I had never made a blogdown site before!

Luckily, blogdown is extremely well documented. My first resource was the book by Yihui, Amber Thomas, Alison Presmanes Hill, [blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). Trying to channel my older brother, who is a big believer in documentation, I set forth to follow the instructions step-by-step.

Although blogdown allows you to specify your site through code prompts, I love using add-ins if they've been offered to you :D

I wish there were more that I could offer than the blogdown book, but honestly, it is so straightforward and easy to follow that anything I write would just be redundant. The biggest issue I had was when I accidentally added an 'i' somewhere in the config.toml code (solved [here](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/solved-help-error-while-parsing-config-4-1-unexpected-token/9592)).

There were some Github hoops I needed to go through because I initially started the project on my local drive instead of in a repo (oops). [Thankfully, Jenny Bryan already has that covered.](http://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-first.html)

Getting this site up and running was a valuable experience (especially since I have to give a talk on it!). And most importantly, I thought of the *coolest* title for the presentation.
