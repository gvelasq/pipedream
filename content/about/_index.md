Hello! My name is Isabella Velásquez.

I’m currently employed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation as a Data Analyst. I graduated from the University of Chicago with an M.S. Analytics in 2016.

Please check out my [Github](https://github.com/ivelasq). I have asked to be included in [R-Weekly](https://rweekly.org/live) and [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/).  

When I am not running analyses for fun, I am playing with my cat, hiking in the mountains around Seattle, or trying to complete a 5.10c climbing route.
